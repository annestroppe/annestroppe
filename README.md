## Welcome

I am a research associate in the Survey Data Curation Department at GESIS - Leibniz Insitute for the Social Sciences and a PhD candidate at the University Mannheim.
In my research. I am working on the effects of spatial disparities on political attitudes anmd party preferences as well as methodological questions related to spatial linking techniques. After working as a data curator for the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), I joined the Competence Center for Data Quality in the Social Sciences (KODAQS) in November 2023. For the KODAQS Academy, I coordinate and create learning content on indicators and metrics to assess data quality for early-career researchers and pracitioners. I also contribute to our open source platform, the KODAQS Toolbox, by developing new tools to systematically asses errors that occur when linking survey data with other data soources.
